search.c

Purpose:
        Many researchers use the stallion gallery to store their project files. However, over time these files get lost in gallery because their naming conventions 
    become insigificant to people who aren't familiarized with them. The purpose of "search.c" is to find file names given a set of keywords associated with
    the project. The program will output all the files that match that description.

How to use:
    ./search <keyword_1> <keyword_2> ... <keyword_n>
    
        The program takes multiple keywords (inputs) at once as long as they are separated by a space. This will output file names that have a specific
    keyword in common (and how many files were found). Note: some key words may share a file name.

          In this implementation I used a "for" loop that finds the keywords given (argv[1], argv[2], ... argv[n]). Each loop runs 2 child processes (fork twice),
          which I used to exec the "grep" and "grep -c" commands and pipe into the stdin. Then, the parent process takes the stdout
