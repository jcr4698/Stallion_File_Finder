search.c

Purpose:

        Many researchers use the stallion gallery to store their project files. However, over time these files get lost in gallery because their naming conventions 
    become insigificant to people who aren't familiarized with them. The purpose of this program is to find the names of these "lost" files and allow researchers
    to make these files easier to find.

Dependencies:

    TL;DR - type these in the termial
        sudo apt install libgtk-3-dev
        sudo apt install gcc
        sudo apt install pkg-config

    -- More information is provided below --

    The GUI uses the GTK3 Library, which can easily be installed using:
        sudo apt install libgtk-3-dev
    To verify whether the dependency is installed you can use:
        dpkg -s libgtk-3-0 | grep 'Version'
    
    GTK3 requires a working version of gcc to compile the C-programs (Linux systems have it by default).
    If not already installed, it can be installed using:
        sudo apt install gcc
    To verify whether the dependency is installed you can use:
        gcc --version
    
    Lastly, to help link the GTK3 Library to the C-programs, gcc requires pkg-config, which can be installed using:
        sudo apt install pkg-config
    To verify whether the dependency is installed you can use:
        pkg-config --version


How to use the Graphical User Intefaces (GUI):

    ./finder

        This command takes no arguments, and brings up a window that prompts the user to enter keyword(s) (separated by a space if more than one)
        that describe the file that you are looking for. When the "Find file" button is pressed, the terminal will output all files that match that description.

        Example Input:
            $ ./finder
              -------------------------------------------------------
            |                         finder                          |

How to use terminal commands:

    ./search <keyword_1> <keyword_2> ... <keyword_n>
    
        The program takes multiple keywords (inputs) at once as long as they are separated by a space. This will output file names that have a specific
    keyword in common (and how many files were found). Note: some key words may share a file name.

    ex.)

    > search.c:
          In this implementation I used a "for" loop that finds the keywords given (argv[1], argv[2], ... argv[n]). Each loop runs 2 child processes (fork twice),
          which I used to exec the "grep" and "grep -c" commands and pipe into the stdin. Then, the parent process takes the stdout
